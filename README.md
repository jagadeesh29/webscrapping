# webscrapping
webscrapping using python
Here I tried to scrape naukri.com
I use BeautifulSoup library and request library for getting the content of the webpage and prettify that content.
Then i wrote a function in python to get all the values from the particular page.
I scrapped "title","company","experience","location","keyskills","posted_date" and write it in a csv file.
